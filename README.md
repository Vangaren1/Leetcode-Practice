# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my structured practice and study solutions for LeetCode problems.

The goal is not simply problem completion, but strengthening:

- Algorithmic pattern recognition
- Data structure fluency
- Clean implementation habits
- Multi-language proficiency

---

## 📚 Repository Structure

### `Daily/`

Solutions to LeetCode Daily Challenges.

Each problem typically contains:

- `README.md` – problem summary and notes
- `Solution.java`
- `*.py` (Python solution)

---

### `NeetCode/`

Problems organized by algorithmic pattern (based on the NeetCode 150 list).

Categories include:

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Heap / Priority Queue
- Greedy
- Intervals
- Math & Geometry
- Bit Manipulation

This section focuses on mastering **core interview patterns**, not just individual problems.

---

### `Grind75/`

Problems organized by weekly progression from the Grind75 roadmap.

---

### `Top150/`

Selected high-frequency interview problems.

---

### `Graph/`, `Matrix/`

Topic-focused deep dives and experimentation.

---

### `common/`

Reusable helper classes:

- `TreeNode`
- `ListNode`
- Shared utilities for local testing

---

## 🛠 Languages Used

- **Python** – Primary language for rapid problem solving and exploration
- **Java** – Used intentionally for structured OOP practice
- **C++ (in progress)** – Focused systems-level and performance-oriented practice

### 🔎 Note on Java & C++

Java and C++ solutions are part of deliberate multi-language practice.

Not every problem is fully implemented in every language. In some cases:

- A solution may exist only in Python
- A Java solution may be partial
- C++ versions are being added progressively

This repository reflects active learning and iteration, not a finalized library of polished implementations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository supports long-term goals of:

- Improving algorithmic fluency
- Developing fast pattern recognition
- Writing clean, maintainable implementations
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Expanding C++ proficiency for systems and infrastructure roles

---

## 🧠 Approach to Problem Solving

For each problem, the focus is on:

1. Identifying the brute-force approach
2. Determining the performance bottleneck
3. Selecting the appropriate data structure or algorithmic pattern
4. Implementing cleanly and iterating when needed

The emphasis is on **understanding patterns**, not memorizing solutions.

---

## 📈 Ongoing Work

- Working through NeetCode 150 in C++
- Refining documentation and pattern organization
- Expanding explanations and edge-case notes
- Strengthening multi-language implementations

---

## 🏗 Why This Repository Is Public

This repository reflects consistent technical practice, structured study, and long-term skill development.

It demonstrates:

- Breadth of problem exposure
- Depth of repetition
- Growth across languages
- Commitment to continuous improvement
